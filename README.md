# Stardust Game
Stardust is a game in which the player attempts to gather the floating stardust while avoiding the falling meteors.  Each thime the players ship is hit by a meteor they lose points, and slowly gain points catching the stardust. There is no winning score, so play as long as you want. I hope you enjoy the game!
